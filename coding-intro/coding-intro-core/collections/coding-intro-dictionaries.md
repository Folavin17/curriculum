# Dictionaries


---

## Content

Dictionaries are associative collections that represent **key/value pairs**.

The name is inspired by our everyday language dictionaries, which are collections of word/definition pairs.

One way to write a dictionary is using curly braces (`{ }`):

```python
# create a my_dog dictionary
# with 3 key/value pairs
my_dog = {
  "name": "Artemis",
  "age": 4,
  "color": "yellow"
}
```

In this example, `name` is the **key**, and `"Artemis"` is the value.

**Note** that different languages have different syntaxes. For instance, the above was written in Python, and requires keys to have quotations. 

The following dictionary is written in JavaScript and doesn't require quotations, but can have them:
```javascript
// create a my_dog dictionary
// with 3 key/value pairs
my_dog = {
  name: "Artemis",
  age: 4,
  "color": "yellow"
}
```

## Practice

Complete the gaps such that the dictionary has `age` as a **key** and `33` for the **value**:

```python
person = {
  "???": ???
}
```

- age
- 33
- key/value
- age/33
- key
- value

## Revision

Match the variable with its data type:

```python
a = [
  1,
  2,
  3
]

b = {
  "one": 1,
  "two": 2,
  "three": 3
}

// ??? is a dictionary
// ??? is an array
```

- b
- a
