Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

If you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[2].

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Print]
Printing usually refers to displaying a piece of text, a number, a collection, or something else.

To do this, you need to use the special `print()` function.

Here is how you would print the test `"Enki"`:

```python
print("Enki")
```

And here is how you would print a collection's element:

```python
print(my_collection[0])
```

[2: Hints]

There are many ways in which you can tackle this. For example, you could create a list that stores weekdays:

```python
days = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday"
]
```


Here is a reminder of how you can access the items:

```python
days[0]
# "Monday"
```
