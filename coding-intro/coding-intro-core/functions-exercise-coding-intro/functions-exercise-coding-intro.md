## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Here's an example to help you get started:

To create a function:

Start by using the `def` keyword followed by the function name.

Inside the parentheses, specify any parameters the function should accept.

```python
def greet(name):
  # function code here
```

To print a value:

Use the `print()` function and provide the value you want to print as an argument:
```python
print("Hello", name)
print(f'Hello {name}')
```


To call the function, you can use the following syntax:
```python
greet("Stefan")
# Hello Stefan
```
