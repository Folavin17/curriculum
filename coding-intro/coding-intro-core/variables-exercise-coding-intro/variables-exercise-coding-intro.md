## Footnotes

[1: Print]
Printing usually refers to displaying a piece of text, a number, a collection, or something else.

To do this, you need to use the special `print()` function.

Here is how you would print the string `"Enki"`:

```python
print("Enki")
```

[2: Hints]

Here's an example to help you get started:

Create some variables:
```python
# String variable
name = "John"

# Numeric variables
age = 25
height = 180.5
```

Then output them:
```python
print("Hello, my name is", name)
# Hello, my name is John

print(f'Hello, my name is {name}')
# Hello, my name is John

print(name)
# John
```
