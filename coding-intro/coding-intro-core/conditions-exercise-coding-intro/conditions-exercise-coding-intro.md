    # Hey there
    # Welcome to your first Python condition exercise

    # Start by creating two variables. Example:
    num1 = 7
    num2 = 4

    # Then, use an if-else statement to compare which is larger
    
    # Then output a message if the first one is larger ("num1 is larger than num2") or vice versa ("num2 is larger than num1")

    # Test your code by assigning different values to num1 and num2 to see the different output messages based on the comparison

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Here's an example to help you get started:

Start by creating two variables, num1 and num2, and assign any numerical values to them.
```python
num1 = 31
numm2 = 333
```

Use an if-else statement to compare the values of num1 and num2.
```python
if num1 > num2:
  # code here
else:
  # code here
```

If num1 is larger than num2, print "num1 is larger than num2".
```python
print(f'{num1} is larger than {num2}')
print(num1, 'is larger than' ,num2)
```

Otherwise, if num2 is larger than num1, print "num2 is larger than num1".
```python
print(f'{num2} is larger than {num1}')
# 333 is larger than 31
print(num2, 'is larger than' ,num1)
# 333 is larger than 31
```

If neither condition is true (i.e., num1 and num2 are equal), print "num1 and num2 are equal".
For this you will need two conditions:
```python
if num1 > num2:
  # print
elif num2 > num1:
  # print
else: 
  # print
```

Test your code by assigning different values to num1 and num2 to observe the different output messages based on the comparison.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different values to further explore the behavior of if-else statements in Python.
