Let's write a Python program!

Who's the last person you met? Do you remember their age?

In the following task, you will store that person's name and age in *variables*. You will also print them to the screen, using **Python**!

After you have stored the variables correctly, the code will still show an error. Something's wrong in one of the `print` functions. 

Your job is to fill out the missing part of the code and fix the existing one. You got this!

Recall the following concepts:

- Double-quotes (`""`) are necessary to store text data.
- We cannot perform numeric operations on text.

Don't worry too much about understanding every part of the code; see if you can solve it as is, but things will become clearer as you go along.

[1: Comments]
Comments are used to explain the code. They do not have any effect on the execution. Depending on the programming language, there are multiple ways to create a *comment*:

```py
# I am a Python comment!
```

```js
// I am a JavaScript comment!
```

```html
<!-- I am an HTML comment! -->
```
