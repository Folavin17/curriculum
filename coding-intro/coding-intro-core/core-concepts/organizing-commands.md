# Organizing Commands With Functions

---
## Content

Functions allow us to break up our program into mini-programs, each for a specific task that we need. 

For instance, suppose we are simulating a human being that loves coffee! 

For every cup of coffee, they need to:

1. find a clean cup
2. boil water
3. open the packet
4. mix the coffee with the boiling water.
5. drink (gulp, gulp)

That's so much work! Instead, imagine if we had one function `make_coffee` with all of these instructions. Every time we want coffee, we write `make_coffee` and, voila! - the work is done.

> ðŸ’¬ Can you think of a function from your everyday life? What's its name and what steps does it contain?
