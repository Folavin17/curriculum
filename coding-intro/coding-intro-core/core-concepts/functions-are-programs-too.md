# Functions are programs too!?

## Content

We can even use other people's programs as functions!

Perhaps someone wrote a smart program called `shortest_path` that calculates the quickest path from point A to point B. 

If we wanted, we could use `shortest_path` as a function in our new food delivery application to show the delivery driver's route.

> ðŸ’¬ Where else could we use the `shortest_path` function?
