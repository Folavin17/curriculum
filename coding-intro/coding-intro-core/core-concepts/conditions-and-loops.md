# Conditions

---
## Content


In computers, there's no maybe. Every question is answered with a *True* or a *False*[1]. 

We can use `if` statements to only run code when a condition is true.

For instance, this code will only turn the light on if the switch is on:
```python
if switch_is_on:
    turn_on_light()
```

> 😵‍💫 Woah...Don't worry if the code looks like gibberish right now! Soon you'll learn all about conditions!

Here `switch_is_on` is a boolean variable. That means it is either true or false.
