# Syntax Basics

## Content

### Identifier naming rules

When naming any function, property or variable, the first character must be a letter, $ sign or underscore:

```javascript
let name = "Enki"; // valid
let $taxRate = 8.25; // valid
let _id = 23; // valid
let 2Company = "Enki"; // not valid
```

### Semicolon

Statements in JavaScript end in a `;`. Based on the ECMAScript[1] rules, however, adding a `;` isn't required (although it is common practice):

```javascript
let firstName = "Enki";
//                    ^
```

Omitting a semicolon in certain situations can cause problems. So JavaScript has a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) which means, if you omit a semicolon, JavaScript will automatically add it where it thinks it should go. [2]

## Footnotes

[1: ECMAScript]
ECMAScript is the specification defining the rules of JavaScript. The features of JavaScript are implemented based on these specifications. 

[2: ASI]
JavaScript ASI will sometimes assume a statement ends where it might not be intended.

For example, the code below:

```js
x 
++ 
y
```

is understod as:

```js
x;
++y;
```

and not as:

```js
x++;
y
```
