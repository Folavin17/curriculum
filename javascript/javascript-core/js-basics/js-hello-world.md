## Content

Let's write our first JavaScript program!

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to use JavaScript's `console.log` function to output **the first thing you'd log if you just landed on Mars**!

Here's how you would say hello to Mars:

```js
console.log('Hello Mars!')
```

And the output displayed in the shell would be:

```plain-text
Hello Mars!
```
