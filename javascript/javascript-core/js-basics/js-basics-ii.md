## Content


Comments can be created in 2 ways in JavaScript.

As a single line comment:

```js
// I am a single line comment
```

You can also add single line comments to the same line as other code:

```javascript
let company="enki"; // define company
```

Or, if you have more text, you can use a block comment:

```javascript
/*
I am a block comment
*/
```
