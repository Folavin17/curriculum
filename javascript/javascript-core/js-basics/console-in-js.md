# Outputting to Console

---

## Content

`console.*` methods display data to the console. For instance, `console.log` prints text or variables:

```js
console.log("Message");
// Message
```

```js
console.log("Username: " + username);
// Username: enkilondon
```

Other methods include:

- `console.warn("Warning")`
- `console.error("Error!")`
- `console.trace()` [1]

The three above are crucial for debugging your code! 

> ðŸ¤” When might `console.warn` be more useful than `console.log`?

## Footnotes

[1: stack trace]
You can think of a stack trace as the "timeline" of your code. It can tell you the ordered steps your program has taken, including the data created along the way.

1. kitchen
2. living room
3. pub
4. ...

You start checking all those places to find your keys. With a stack trace, you do the same thing. The only difference is you're not looking for your keys; most of the time you're looking for an error in your code ðŸ˜…
