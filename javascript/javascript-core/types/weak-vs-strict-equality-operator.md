# Weak vs Strict equality operator


---

## Content

In JavaScript, there are two ways to check if values equal each other.

### Weak Typing `==`

The operator `==` coerces (converts) types before comparing the terms. Using `==` to compare two values will first force the values to have the same type before comparing them.

For example, we can force `'2'` into a number before comparing:

```js
console.log('2' == 2); // True
```

> ðŸ’¡ The **weak equality operator** (`==`) is also refered to as **loose** or **abstract**.

### Strict Typing `===`

The strict equality operator `===` works as `==`, but without type coercion. Using `===` will require us to match both the type and the value:

```js
console.log('2' === 2) // false
```

Using `==` is generally considered bad practice as it could lead to bugs in the code. 

> ðŸ¤” What kind of problems do you think using weak equality operators can cause? Can you think of an example?

## Practice

Match the type name with the operator:

```plain-text
==  - ???
=== - ???
```

Fill in the gaps with the correct equality operator to get the output:

```js
"19" ??? 19
// true

"nk" ??? "nk"
// true
```

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Weak equality operators can cause difficult-to-locate bugs due to unexpected type conversions.
