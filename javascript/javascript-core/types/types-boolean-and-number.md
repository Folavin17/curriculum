#  Strings


---

## Content

To store any sequence of characters, whether its one letter or multiple sentences, we use strings.

A string is always wrapped in either `'single'` or `"double quotes"`

```javascript
let company = "Enki";
let google_search = 'How to learn JavaScript in one day';
```

We can also perform operations on strings like the following:

```javascript
google_search.length // 34
```
