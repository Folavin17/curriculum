# Variables


---

## Content

The building blocks of Javascript are variables!

We can create and change the value a variable like so:

```javascript
let firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // this works
```

We can also declare a variable using `const`, but in this case we cannot change what it points to:

```javascript
const firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // Error!
```

The final (and the oldest) way of declaring a variable in JavaScript is by using `var`:

```javascript
var firstName = "Enki";
firstName = "Changed"; // this works
```

We'll learn more about the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var` later on.
