# Undefined


---

## Content


When a variable is created without being assigned a value, its value is `undefined`. We can test this by using the `typeof` operator which returns the data type of the given variable.


```js
let life_goals;
console.log(typeof life_goals); // undefined
```

The way to think of `undefined` is as the default value assigned to anything without an assigned value.
