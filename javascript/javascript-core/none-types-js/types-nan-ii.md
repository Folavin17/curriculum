# The isNaN function


---

## Content

Imagine we needed to collect the `age` of every person in a classroom so that we may find the oldest person present. It's a simple calculation that could become quite complex if some of the `age` values are text instead of numbers.

We can tackle this issue using the `isNaN` function. If it's not a number, it will return true. Otherwise, false.

```js
isNaN(23) // false (it's a number)
isNaN("Twenty Three") // true (it's not a number)
```

> ðŸ¤” Where else could we use the `isNaN` function to make our lives easier?
