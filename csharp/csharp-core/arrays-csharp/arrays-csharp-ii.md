# Arrays

---

## Content

To assign values to the array:
```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

And to access an element in the array, use the index of that element (keep in mind that indexing starts at 0):
```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);  
// Output: 1
```

---

## Practice

Fill in the code to create an integer array called `nums` that holds numbers from 1 through 5:

```csharp
???[] ??? = new int[] {???};
```


- int
- nums
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- 1-5
- integers
- numbers

---

## Revision

Fill in the code to output the number 7 from the `numbers` array using its index:
```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[] {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};
Console.WriteLine(numbers[???]);  
// Output: 7
```

- 3
- 7
