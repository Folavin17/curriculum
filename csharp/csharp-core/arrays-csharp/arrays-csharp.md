# Arrays

---

## Content

An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by an index.

Here's how you define an array in C#:
```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[5];
```

In this example, `numbers` is an array that can hold 5 integers.

> Arrays in **C#** are fixed in size. If you need a collection that isn't fixed, you can use `Lists` (more on this in a later workout).
