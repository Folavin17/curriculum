# What is C-Sharp?

---

## Content

**C#** (C-Sharp) is a powerful[1] programming language developed by Microsoft. 

It's a versatile language used for Desktop, Mobile, Web, and even Game Development.

Here's an example of C# code where we find out how many pizzas two superheroes ate combined:
```csharp
int spiderman = 3;
int batman = 5;
Console.WriteLine("Together, they ate " + (spiderman + batman) + " pizzas!");
// Together, they ate 8 pizzas!
```

> Do not worry if you don't understand the code, we will dive deeper into it later on.

## Footnotes

[1: C# as a Language]

**C#** is an object-oriented, compiled language.

That means when you write C# code, it doesn't run directly; instead, it undergoes a transformative process using a compiler.

The compiler:

-  Reads your C# code
- Translates C# into Common Intermediate Language (CIL)
- When executed, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler turns CIL into machine code.
