# What is Blazor?

---

## Content


Blazor is a cutting-edge framework from Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C#.

Instead of relying solely on JavaScript for client-side logic, with Blazor, you can harness C# directly in the browser via WebAssembly[1]. 

This means you can craft dynamic web UIs and components leveraging your C# expertise, streamlining the entire web development process. 🌐💻🚀

## Footnotes

[1: WebAssembly]

In simple terms, WebAssembly is a way to run code written in languages other than JavaScript, like C or Rust, directly in the browser at near-native speed. This opens the door for high-performance web applications and allows diverse programming languages to be used for web development. 🌐
