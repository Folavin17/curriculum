# while Loops


---

## Content

A `while` loop continues executing the code block as long as the condition is true:

```csharp
int i = 0;

while(i < 5)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
```

This loop will print the numbers from `0` to `4`. It will continue to run as long as `i` is less than `5`.


---
## Practice

Fill in the blank to output the numbers 1 to 10:

```csharp
int i = 0;

???(i ???)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
```

- `while`
- `< 11`
- `> 11`
- `for`
