# for loops

---
## Content

A `for` loop is used when we know beforehand how many times we want to execute a block of code.
It is defined with three parameters: 
1. The initialization
2. The condition
3. The increment.

Here's an example of a `for` loop:

```csharp
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
  Console.Write(i);
}
// 01234
```

This loop will print the numbers from `0` to `4`. The variable `i` is initialized with `0` and incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than 5.

---
## Practice

Finish the following code snippet to make the loop print numbers from 0 to 9.

```csharp
???(int i = 0; i ???; i++)
{
  Console.Write(i);
}
// 0123456789
```

- for
- `< 10`
- `<= 10`
- `> 10`
- `>= 10`
- while

## Revision

```csharp
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
// Output: ???
```
