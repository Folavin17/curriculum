# && and || Operator

---

## Content

The `&&` operator returns true if both operands are true:

```csharp
if(true && false)
{
  // This won't execute
}
```

## OR
The `||` operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true. If both are false, it returns false:

```csharp
if(true || false)
{
  // This will execute
}
```

---

## Practice

What will this code block output?

```csharp
bool a = true;
bool b = true;

if(a && b)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Both variables are true.");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("At least one of the variables is false.");
}
// Output: ???
```

- Both variables are true.
- At least one of the variables is false.

---

## Revision

Fill in the code to match the output.

```csharp
bool a = ???;
bool b = true;

if(a ??? b)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Both a and b are true.");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("At least one of a or b is false.");
}
// Output: Both a and b are true.
```

- true
- &&
- false
