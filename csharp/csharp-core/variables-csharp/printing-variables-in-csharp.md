# Printing

---

## Content

In **C#**, you can use the `Console.Write()` method to print a message to the console without moving to a new line:
```csharp
Console.Write("Hello, world!");
```

To also move to a new line after printing, you can use the `Console.WriteLine()` method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
```

To output a value from a variable you can do:
```csharp
int num = 5;
Console.WriteLine("num is equal to " + num);

// num is equal to 5
```
