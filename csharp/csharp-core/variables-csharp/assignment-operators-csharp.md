# Assignment Operators

---

## Content

In C#, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

```csharp
int x = 3;
int y = 15;

Console.WriteLine(x);
// Outputs: 3
Console.WriteLine(y);
// Outputs: 15
```

C# also includes compound assignment operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=`. These operators modify the value of the variable:

```csharp
// equivalent to x = x + 5
x += 5;

// equivalent to y = y / 3
y /= 3;
```
