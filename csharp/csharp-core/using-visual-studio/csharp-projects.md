# Creating C# Projects

---

## Content


The best way to learn code is to write some!

Let's use Visual Studio to create a Console App called HelloWorld.

Once your project is created, our project directory should now contain:

- Program.cs: We use .cs files to write C# code. 
- HelloWorld.csproj: This file tells Visual Studio how to build and execute our application (no need to worry about it yet!)
- Dependencies Folder: Almost all C# projects will depend on other tools and frameworks, like .NET.
