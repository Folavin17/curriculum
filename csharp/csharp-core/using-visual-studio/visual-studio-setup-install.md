Visual Studio is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 

You can download it from [Microsoft's Visual Studio Website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

When the installer prompts you, make sure to also install `.NET Core`.

Remember, **C#** without **.NET** is like a Chef without any recipesüë®‚Äçüç≥[1]!

## Footnotes

[1: Why you need .NET]

- Libraries & Classes: .NET provides vast libraries full of pre-written code. This means you don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel; there's probably a .NET class or method for what you need.

- Runtime Environment: .NET includes a Common Language Runtime (CLR) that compiles and executes C# code. It manages memory, handles exceptions, and provides garbage collection.

- Development Tools: With .NET, you get development environments like Visual Studio which make it easier to write, debug, and test C# code.

- Versatility: Whether you want to develop desktop applications, web apps (using ASP.NET), or even mobile apps, .NET has the tools and libraries you'll need.

- Interoperability: .NET allows C# to work seamlessly with other languages and technologies, making integration simpler.
