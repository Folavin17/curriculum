# The NF in NFT = Non-Fungible

## Content

What is the NF in NFT? Non-fungible!

Non-fungible loosely means non-replaceable. There is only one of them.

Suppose you wish to purchase a specific pair of green pants from Zara. When you order them, you wouldn't care about which exact pair is delivered.

Zara will most likely manufacture thousands of the same pants in your size and send them to stores and people like you. Thus, these pants would be fungible - theyâ€™re replaceable. 

However, letâ€™s talk about a pair of green pants youâ€™ve had for many years. Even if you try to buy the same thing online, it won't be the exact same pair of green pants you've owned.

They would be irreplaceable, and hence, non-fungible. The only one on the planet that exists. They have emotional value and significance because they're scarce.

> ðŸ’¡ Everything in our economy is either fungible or non-fungible.[1]

[1: Fungible and Non-fungible]

A pack of Trader Joeâ€™s tortillas â€” fungible; the Mona Lisa â€” non-fungible.

Unsurprisingly, non-fungible things are way more valuable than fungible things.
