# The T in NFT (Token)

What are Tokens?

On a high-level, a token is a digital asset that exists on the blockchain and can only be owned by one account (i.e. one blockchain address).

For example, you can't replace the Vengeful war babies images[1] with Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet[2] becaucse blockchain data can't be changed.

Hence, non-fungible token (irreplaceable digital asset).

The most well-known NFTs currently exist on the Ethereum Blockchain, but they’re represented in different ways than coins, using the ERC-721 standard [3], which states:

> 💡 “A non-fungible token (NFT) is used to identify something or someone in a unique way. This type of token is perfect to be used on platforms that offer collectible items, access keys, lottery tickets, numbered seats for concerts and sports matches, etc.”

[3: ERC-721 Standard]
Firstly, ERC-721 is a type of standard — a template or format that other developers agree to follow. Following the same standards makes writing code easier, more predictable, and reusable. ERC-721 is a token standard on Ethereum for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
