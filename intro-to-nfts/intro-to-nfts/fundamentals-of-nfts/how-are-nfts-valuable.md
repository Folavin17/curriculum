# How are NFTs valuable?

---
## Content

NFTs have no fixed value, and just like most goods, it's entirely based on demand.

The general aim, similar to any collectible, is to trade NFTs for income or own them for status.

### Income

You can earn NFTs by playing games, or you can buy them on NFT marketplaces.

To earn money, you can sell them at a higher price - therefore making a profit. 

### Status

You might buy a desirable NFT from a famous collection like BAYC or made by a famous artist like Beeple.

You could also buy and keep NFTs from artists you really like.


### Custom features

Artists can add royalties into their NFTs.

This means that, whenever the NFT changes hands, the artist automatically receives a percentage of the sale value.
