## Content

### Create a Piece of Art

You first need to create a piece of art that you’ll want to turn into an NFT.  You may decide to make a digital image, audio production, or video[1]. 

### Choose a Blockchain

A creator must figure out which blockchain they want to issue their NFTs on. 

Ethereum is the most popular blockchain at this time, but a variety of other blockchains are gaining popularity, such as: Cosmos, Tezos, Polkadot, Flow, Binance Smart Chain, etc.

### Get a Wallet

You’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet to pay a marketplace’s fees and receive payment once you start selling your NFTs such as: Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Enjin, and D’Cent.
