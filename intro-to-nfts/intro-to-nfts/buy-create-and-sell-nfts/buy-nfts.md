# How to Buy NFTs

---
## Content

Before learning how to buy NFT tokens, there are a few things worth considering:
 - What marketplace do you intend to use?
 - Which cryptocurrency will be needed to make the purchase?
 - Are the NFTs only available at a certain time, like during an NFT drop?

For example, someone who wants to buy an NBA Top Shot pack of virtual trading cards must open an account with NBA Top Shot and create a Dapper wallet. 

Once you've connected your wallet to the NFT marketplace, you can start browsing the marketplace's offerings and make a purchase. 

NFT marketplaces include OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, Nifty Gateway, Reddit, Instagram etc.
