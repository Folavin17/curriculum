# How to Sell NFTs

---
## Content

### Find a Marketplace

Depending on your art and interests, you may choose a curated marketplace that specializes in specific kinds of art or a general open marketplace.

### Minting an NFT

NFT marketplaces offer a step-by-step guide for uploading your digital file to their platform. That process will enable you to turn your digital art into a marketable NFT by adding it to the blockchain, known as minting an NFT.

### Sell your NFT

Once youâ€™ve minted your NFT, you can choose to sell it. There are generally three ways to sell your NFT:

 - Fixed price: This allows you to set a price for the NFT and sell it instantly if a buyer is willing to buy the NFT at that price.

 - Timed auction: A timed auction will give those interested in your NFT a time limit to submit bids.

 - Unlimited auction: There is no set time limit with an unlimited auction. Instead, the seller can choose to end the auction whenever they want.
