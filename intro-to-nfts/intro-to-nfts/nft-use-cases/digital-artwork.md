A common question about digital artwork NFTs is: what can you do with it?

These works can be exhibited in galleries, museums, online collections, as well as virtual worlds.

A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of an NFT making it not really scarce.

The same argument could apply to physical items. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it still isnâ€™t the real item from the artist.

See?

People are willing to pay a premium for original work, and NFTs (via a blockchain) make it trivial to verify authenticity. 

> ðŸ’¡ It's the authenticity and scarcity that is giving an NFT its value, not just its visual appearance.[1]

## Footnotes
[1: Salvador Dali example]

For instance, Salvador Dali used to pay for his meals by signing napkins for restaurant owners, so even if you create an exact replica of a Dali-signed napkin itâ€™s still not the original.
