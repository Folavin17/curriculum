# Part 1: Why are NFTs interesting?

---
## Content

The acronym "NFT" stands for non-fungible token. On a high level, NFTs are irreplaceable digital assets traded on a blockchain. [1]

### Transfer of Ownership

NFT are interoperable, which means that they can be connected, exchanged, or traded over different platforms that operate on the blockchain.

For example, two games that are created and designed on the Ethereum blockchain[2] can easily support the same in-game collectibles like vehicles, weapons, armor, or even entire characters.[3]

### Transparency

As NFT operates on the blockchain, the presence and history of ownership are unalterable and accessible to the public.

## Footnotes
[1: NFTs as collectibles]

People love collectibles, and NFTs combined with other financial building blocks enabled by a blockchain, allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them.

[2: Ethereum]

At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized global software platform powered by blockchain technology. It is most commonly known for its native cryptocurrency, ether (EH). 

Ethereum can be used by anyone to create any secured digital technology. It has a token designed to pay for work done supporting the blockchain, but participants can also use it to pay for tangible goods and services if accepted.

[3: NFT can do much more] 

NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. NIFTEX), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. NFTfi).

NFT fractionalization is simply the act of dividing the ownership of an NFT into smaller fractions. This makes it possible for several people to own a single NFT.
