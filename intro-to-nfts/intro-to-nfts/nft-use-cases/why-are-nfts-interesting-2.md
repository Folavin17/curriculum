# Part 2: Why are NFTs interesting?

---
## Content

### Social Tokens

NFTs can be used to represent anything from a person's time to specialized access to a community's shared ownership, similar to how stocks work.

You own X units of something and can vote on how that something is used, or what it does, or trade your X units with someone.[2]

### Licenses and Certifications

As NFTs contain unique codes, they can also be used to tokenize documentation such as degrees, academic certificates, or licenses. 

Because they're on the public immutable[1] blockchain, it's straightforward to confirm both the existence and authenticity of tokenized documents.

## Footnotes

[1: Blockchains are immutable]

Once a piece of data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with. 

This means that, blockchains work great for storing factual data whos authenticity needs to be verified. 

[2: Social Tokens example]

For example, Reuben Bramanathan, who previously worked on legal and product at Coinbase, tokenized his time where 1 $CSNL token equaled 1 hour of his time and was freely traded.
