# What is Prompt Engineering

---

## Content

**Prompt engineering** is a novel approach in natural language processing (NLP)[1]. 

In prompt engineering, the description of the task that the AI is supposed to accomplish is embedded in the input - for example, as a question (or "prompt") - instead of it being explicitly given.

By fine-tuning the language and structure of the prompts, you can guide the model to generate more accurate and pertinent responses.

Using algorithms and models, NLP facilitates computers to process and analyze substantial volumes of natural language data including text, speech, and images containing words.
