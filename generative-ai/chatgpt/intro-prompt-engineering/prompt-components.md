# Prompt Components

---

## Content

Not every prompt requires all three key components (context, instructions, and output). 

In some cases, only one or two may be necessary.

![simple-tell-me-a-joke-prompt](https://img.enkipro.com/b29225310c33587cce17ac6764ee4a39.png)

In the example above, there is no context or output data - only the input.

The context is assumed based on the "joke" input.

Here's another example only with input data:

![square-root-of-a-number-no-context-prompt](https://img.enkipro.com/f4a7beb6b202a14bd278521268a09b3a.png)

The outputs have no formatting, so it's assumed it should be humorous with the intention of making someone laugh in the first one and the result of the calculation in the second one.

However, when creating complex prompts, in order to get an accurate response, your prompt should contain context.

Take a look at these example with, and without, context:

> ðŸ’¬ Can you think of good prompts without the three key components?

## Practice 

True or false?

We always have to provide context, instructions and give data to be able to get a response.
