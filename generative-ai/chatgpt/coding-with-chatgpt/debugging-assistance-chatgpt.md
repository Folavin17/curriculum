## Content

With ChatGPT, you have a powerful ally while debugging.

You can use it to detect errors, troubleshoot techniques, save time, and more.

To debug, we need to paste a code snippet and, depending on what we want, ask something along these lines:

```plain-text
1) Identify any errors in the following Python code and suggest possible fixes.

# Paste code snippet here

2) How can I debug this specific issue in JavaScript?

// Paste code snippet here

3) ...
```

Let's look at some examples.

Identifying errors in Python code:

```javascript
// What are some troubleshooting techniques to handle potential issues in this JavaScript code that fetches data from an API?

function fetchData(url) {
  fetch(url)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
}

fetchData("https://api.example.com/data");
