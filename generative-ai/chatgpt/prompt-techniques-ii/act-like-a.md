The **Act as** prompt is a great way of teaching the AI to act like or respond as a rapper, singer, writer, teacher, grammar checker, terminal, or even Excel sheet!

These are powerful prompts that allow you to teach the AI to act as something or someone.

Here are several examples:

Copy and paste the following prompt in a new comment to chat with our AI:

> Act like a Python terminal. I will give you the code, and you will reply exactly as a terminal would. Do not give any explanations that a terminal wouldn't. Input: print("Hello world!")

After the bot replies, you can continue to only send commands.
