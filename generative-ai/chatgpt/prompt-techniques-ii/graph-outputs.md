Although ChatGPT can't create normal graphs, you can instruct it to create them using ASCII art.

Here's an example input:

Response graph:

Even though the graphs are not of great quality, you can use this feature to get a rough estimate.

Alternatively, you can ask it how to plot a graph in Excel or another platform:
