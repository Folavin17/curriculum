# Rewrite My Code

---

## Content

Did you know ChatGPT can rewrite your code for you?

Here's an example:
![rewrite-if-code-to-use-ternary](https://img.enkipro.com/791739511ff5db75c540cae627997ada.png)

Here are a few more examples:
![rewrite-this-code-using-async-await](https://img.enkipro.com/718cbdb6bac3c1ff84cf4f3bee773dd7.png)

![rewrite-the-previous-code-using-arrow-functions](https://img.enkipro.com/807d78d5cfe4d1f8bcf119f85d27fa81.png)

We can also tell it to simplify:

or optimize your code:

As you can see from the above examples, a single different keyword can make the output differ.
