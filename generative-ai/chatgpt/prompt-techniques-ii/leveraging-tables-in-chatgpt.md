# Leveraging Tables

## Content

ChatGPT has the ability to produce different types of outputs. It can give you code blocks, lists, tables and more. Let's see how that looks:

In the above image, it gave us a list of operator names, their signs, explanations and examples.

Let's convert that output to a markdown table:

Here's one way we could shorten the examples:

Then we will also number each row. Here's how the resulting table looks:
