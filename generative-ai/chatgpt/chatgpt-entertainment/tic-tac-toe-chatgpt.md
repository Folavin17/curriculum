# Tic Tac Toe

## Content

Let's continue playing the game.

Note: Throughout the game, chatGPT makes a mistake and wrongfully finished the game. So we will teach it that it didn't end and make it restart from the point of the mistake using prompts.

Here we make a first move, and the ai makes its first move:

Then we both make a second move:

Then ChatGPT makes a mistake:

It wrongfully assumed the game ended. So we will tell it to revert back to the previous board.
