# Prompt Techniques

---

## Content

There are several prompting techniques to be aware of for training or guiding an AI to perform tasks.

Three useful techniques are called **few-shot** prompting, **zero-shot** prompting and **chain-of-thought** prompting.

### Few-Shot
---

**Few-shot** prompting refers to giving an AI a limited number of examples and expecting it to perform a task correctly on new, unseen inputs.

### Zero-Shot
---

**Zero-shot** prompting doesn't rely on examples. It is expected from the AI to understand and execute a task based on the given textual description. The model is expected to use its pre-existing knowledge.

### Chain-Of-Thought
---

**Chain-of-thought** prompting is a technique where the AI model generates a sequence of coherent responses to achieve a specific goal or complete a task. 

This method encourages the model to maintain context throughout a series of prompts, simulating a more natural thought process. 

We'll dive into some examples on each of these in the insights coming up!
