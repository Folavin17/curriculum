# Is ML magic?

---
## Content

Machine learning is based on the idea of teaching computers to learn and make decisions by themselves, just like humans do.

Instead of providing explicit instructions, machine learning algorithms learn from examples to identify patterns and make predictions.

For example, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on a set of images labeled as "cats" and "not-cats" to identify and label new images as either "cats" or "not-cats".

By understanding the basic principles of machine learning, you can start to see how this powerful technology is used in various applications.
