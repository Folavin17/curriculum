# Unsupervised Learning Example

---
## Content

A common result of unsupervised learning is finding similar groups within your data, called *clustering*.

Imagine you're given a spreadsheet of students containing the hours they spent learning and the grade they got on the test.

An unsupervised ML algorithm could organize the data into two clusters, which you can use to predict if a student is likely to pass a test based on which cluster they fall into.
