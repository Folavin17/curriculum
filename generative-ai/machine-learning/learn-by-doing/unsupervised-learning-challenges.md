# Unsupervised Learning Challenges

---
## Content

### Difficult interpretation

Just because we have clustered groups doesn't mean those groups are useful.

### Irrelevant results

Without labeled data, it's difficult to identify the most relevant features and patterns.

### Hard to measure success

There's no clear target to guide the learning process and evaluate its performance.

## Practice

One of these NOT a drawback of unsupervised learning:

???

- adaptability
- interpretation
- success evaluation
- outcome relevance
