# Overfitting

---
## Content

Overfitting happens when a model captures not only the underlying patterns in the data but also the noise or random fluctuations.

This means it will perform well on the training data but poorly on real-world data.

A simple example is when a student studies only one specific test and then performs poorly on a similar test that covers slightly different material.

The student **overfitted** their knowledge to the specific test and didn't develop a general understanding of the subject.

## Practice

When a machine learning model is overfitting, it means it's capturing:

???

- patterns and noise
- patterns
- noise

---
## Revision

A common problem in machine learning where a model becomes too complex and captures not only the underlying patterns in the data but also the noise or random fluctuations is called ???.

- overfitting
- global capturing
- counterfeiting
- generalization
