# Selecting Data Features

---
## Content

### Features should be relevant to your goal

Imagine you're trying to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on their medical records. Useful features might include age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. but probably not height or race.

> ðŸ’¡ Domain knowledge can help you select the most meaningful features.

### Features should be independent and not redundant

If you were predicting the price of a house, having both the square footage and the number of rooms could be considered redundant since the number of rooms is usually a good indicator of the square footage.

### Be careful of too many features

Having a high number of features requires more computational resources and can significantly slow down the training process.
