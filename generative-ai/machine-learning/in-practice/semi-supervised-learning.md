# Semi-supervised Learning

---
## Content

Supervised learning is accurate but expensive as it requires labelling a lot of data ahead of time.

Unsupervised learning is less accurate but cheap because we can start using it with no data prep.

> ðŸ’¡ Semi-supervised model is more accurate than an unsupervised one and is more affordable than a supervised one.

In practice,Â we combine the two by using a small amount of labeled data to supervise the learning process and a large amount of unlabeled data to further improve the accuracy.

This gives the model improved performance and generalization because the availability of labeled data is often a bottleneck in real-world applications.

## Practice

Semi-supervised learning is cost-effective because it utilizes a smaller ??? dataset and a larger ??? dataset.

- labeled
- unlabeled

## Revision

If you have a limited amount of labeled data and a great amount of unlabeled data, the ideal learning technique you should use is ??? learning.
