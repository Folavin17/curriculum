# Linear Models

---
## Content

> ðŸ’¡ In day-to-day use, the term *linear regression* is used as synonymous with the term linear model.

Imagine that you want to predict how much a pizza will cost based on its size. 

A linear model would represent the relationship between the size of the pizza and its cost as a straight line.

The chart could show a relationship ship such that, for every inch of pizza, the price grows by $2.

This means that by knowing the size of a pizza, you can predict its price.

## Practice

Imagine you're a real estate agent and you have data on the square footage and selling price of various houses. 

You can use a ??? to model the relationship between these two variables. 

The line you fit to this data can then be used to predict the selling price of a house based on its square footage.

- linear regression
- modeled linearization
- line prediction
- lunar progression

## Revision

The chart below shows house sizes (X-axis) and house prices (Y-axis). 

![house-price-to-size](https://img.enkipro.com/5fd0831d8e394c5417872a0de4b0d9fc.png)

Given the square footage of a house, we can use this chart to estimate how much the house is worth.

This approach is called a ??? model.

- modular
- lunar
