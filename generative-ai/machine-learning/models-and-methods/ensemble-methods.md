# Ensemble Methods

---
## Content

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to make a prediction.

It's like having a team of superheroes, each with their own unique abilities, working together to defeat the villain.

> ðŸ’¡ Ensemble methods can often improve the performance of a single model, by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Imagine you and your friends are guessing the weight of a bull.

If one person makes a guess, they might be off by a significant amount. 

But if you ask multiple people to guess, you can average their answers to get a better estimate of the bull's weight. 

This is similar to how we combine the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate overall result.

## Practice

Consider a scenario where you have 10 different weather forecasters who each make daily predictions about the temperature in your city. 

You can combine their individual predictions to make a single, more accurate prediction about the temperature. 

This can be done in a number of ways, such as taking the average of their predictions, or weighting some forecasters more heavily than others based on their past accuracy.

Techniques for combining machine learning models to make more accurate predictions are called ???.

- ensemble methods
- aggregation pipelines
- organization tools
- model grouping
