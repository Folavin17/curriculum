# Simple Layers Make Complex Decisions

---
## Content

The Neural Network neurons are organized in a series of layers, with each layer passing the results on to the next one.

![Neural Network Layers](https://img.enkipro.com/e07925af183fbc3d305c7b70acf03927.png).

Think of a neural network as a multi-story building in charge of making a decision.

Each floor is in charge of one aspect of the decision, and contains many specialist (and biased) decision makers.

Each decision maker is in charge of a tiny detail.

The decisions propagate from one floor to the next, arriving at the rooftop with the final result.

> ðŸ’¡ Neural networks make complex decisions by combining specialized layers of specialist decision makers.
