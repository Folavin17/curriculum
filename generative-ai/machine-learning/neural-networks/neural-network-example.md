# Neural Network Example

---
## Content

When trying to determine if an image contains an elephant, a neuron might be trained to have a high weight for the presence of large gray shapes (as these are likely to indicate an elephant). 

On the other hand, the neuron might also have a bias that suggests that any image containing a large gray shape is more likely to contain an elephant, regardless of other features in the image. 

This bias represents the neuron's innate confidence in the presence of an elephant, based on its previous experience or training.
