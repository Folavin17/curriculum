# Reinforcement Learning Challenges

---
## Content

### Defining the reward can be difficult

A poorly designed reward function can lead to suboptimal or even incorrect behavior.

### Time-consuming and expensive

We might need a lot of trial-and-error decisions before the model can learn a good policy.

### Exploration vs Implementation

A model must balance the need to learn by exploring its environment with the need to exploit what it already learned to achieve its goals.
