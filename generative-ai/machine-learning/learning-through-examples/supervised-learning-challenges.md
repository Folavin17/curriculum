# Supervised Learning Challenges

---
## Content

### Expensive

Supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data to train the model effectively, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.

### Not generalized

If a model is trained on data that is not representative of the real-world, it may perform poorly on new unseen data.

### Sensitivity to irrelevant features

If a model is trained on noisy or irrelevant features, it can negatively impact the accuracy of the model.

### Human biases

If the labeled data used to train a model is biased in some way, this bias will be reflected in the model's predictions.
