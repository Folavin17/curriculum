# Supervised Learning Example

---
## Content

Imagine that you wanted to predict a label based on a given shape.

> ðŸ’¡ Predicting a label is called **classification**.

Squares should go into the "square" box, triangles into the "triangle" box, etc.

Imaging that you wanted to predict the price of a pizza based on its size.

> ðŸ’¡ Predicting a value is called **regression**.

We plot a chart of size vs price and a line of best fit gives us the prediction.
