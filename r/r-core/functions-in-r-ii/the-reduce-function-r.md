# The reduce Function

---

## Content

The reduce function is a useful function in R that allows you to apply a function to a list or vector, and return a single value that is the result of the function applied to the elements of the list or vector. This can be useful for reducing a large dataset to a single summary statistic, or for applying a function to a list of values one element at a time.

Here is the basic syntax of the reduce function:
```r
reduce(x, f, init, right = FALSE, accumulate = FALSE)
```

- `x` is the list or vector that you want to apply the function to.
- `f` is the function that you want to apply to the list or vector.
- `init` is an optional argument that specifies the initial value for the function. If `init` is not specified, the function is applied to the first two elements of the list or vector.
- `right` is an optional argument that specifies whether the function should be applied from left to right (if `right = FALSE`) or from right to left (`if right = TRUE`).
- `accumulate` is an optional argument that specifies whether the function should return a single value (`if accumulate = FALSE`) or a vector of intermediate results (`if accumulate = TRUE`).

Here is an example of how to use the `reduce` function to apply a function to a list of values one element at a time:
```r
x <- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
f <- function(x, y) x + y
reduce(x, f)
# 15
```

## Practice

In the following code snippet, what is the final value of result?

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result <- reduce(x, `*`)
# ???
```

- `120`
- `15`
- `5`
- `1`
