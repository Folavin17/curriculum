# More about Dictionaries in R

## Content

In addition to accessing elements in a dictionary (or list) as shown in the previous insight, you can also add and remove elements.

To add an element to a list, you can use the `[[<-]]` or `[<-]` operators:
```r
fruits <- list(apple = "red", orange = "orange")
fruits[[4]] <- "green"
fruits["banana"] <- "yellow"

print(fruits)
# $apple
# [1] "red"
#
# $orange
# [1] "orange"
#
# $banana
# [1] "yellow"
#
# $`4`
# [1] "green"
```

You can also use the `$<-` operator to add an element with a specific key:
```r
fruits$kiwi <- "brown"

print(fruits)
# $apple
# [1] "red"
#
# $orange
# [1] "orange"
#
# $banana
# [1] "yellow"
#
# $`4`
# [1] "green"
#
# $kiwi
# [1] "brown"

```

To remove an element from a list, you can use the `-` operator:
```r
fruits <- list(apple = "red", orange = "orange", banana = "yellow")
fruits <- fruits[-2]

print(fruits)
# $apple
# [1] "red"
#
# $banana
# [1] "yellow"
```

You can also use the rm() function to remove an element by its key:
```r
fruits <- list(apple = "red", orange = "orange", banana = "yellow")
rm(fruits$orange)

print(fruits)
# $apple
# [1] "red"
#
# $banana
# [1] "yellow"
```
