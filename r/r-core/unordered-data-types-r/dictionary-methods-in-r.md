# Dictionary Methods in R

---

## Content

`R` has several functions for working with dictionaries. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

Consider the following dictionary:
```r
square_numbers <- c(
  1: 1,
  2: 4,
  3: 9, 
  4: 16, 
  5: 25
)
```

`rm()` removes all items from the dictionary
```r
rm(square_numbers)

print(square_numbers)
# NULL
```

names() returns the names of the elements in the dictionary as a character vector

```r
names(square_numbers)

print(names(square_numbers))
# "1" "2" "3" "4" "5"
```
