# Introduction to Dictionaries in R

---

## Content


In **R**, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a **map** or **hash** table in other programming languages. You can use dictionaries to store data that you want to access by a unique identifier (the key) rather than an index.

In `R`, you can create dictionaries similarly to lists.

Here is an example of a dictionary:
```r
fruits <- c(apple = "red", orange = "orange", banana = "yellow")
```

Difference between a dictionary and a list in R is that elements in a Dictionary have a name (key). 

To access an element in a dictionary, you can use either the `[[]]` or `[]` operator for indices or the key. 

For example:
```r
fruits[[1]]
# "red"

fruits[1]
# apple 
# "red"

fruits["apple"]
# apple 
# "red" 

fruits[["apple"]]
# "red"
```

You can also use the `names()` function to get a character vector of the names of the elements in a list:
```r
names(fruits)
# "apple" "orange" "banana"
```

And the `length()` function to get the number of elements in a list:
```r
length(fruits)
# 3
```
