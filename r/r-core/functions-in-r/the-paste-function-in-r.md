# paste Function

---

## Content

The `paste` function in **R** is a versatile tool that allows you to combine or concatenate strings, variables, and other objects. In this insight, we will take a look at some examples of how to use the `paste` function in **R**.

The most basic usage of the paste function is to combine two or more strings into a single string. Here is an example:
```r
paste("Hello", "world!")  
# "Hello world!"
```

You can also specify a separator to use between the strings:
```r
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")  
# "Hello world!"
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = "-") 
# "Hello-world!"
```

The paste function can also combine variables, such as numbers or vectors:
```r
x <- 10
y <- 20
paste("The sum of x and y is", x + y)  
# "The sum of x and y is 30"

z <- c("red", "green", "blue")
paste("The colors are", z)  
# "The colors are red green blue"
```

## Practice

Fill in the gap to combine the strings `"Hello"` and `"world!"` into a single string:

```r
paste(???, ???)
# "Hello world!"
```

- `"Hello"`
- `"world!"`
- `"Hello!", "world"`
- `"Hi", "world!"`
