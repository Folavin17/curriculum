# More on the paste Function

---

## Content

The `paste` function has several optional arguments that allow you to customize the output. For example, you can use the `collapse` argument to specify a separator to use between the elements of a vector:
```r
z <- c("red", "green", "blue")
paste(z, collapse = ", ")  
# "red, green, blue"
```

You can also use the `sep` and `collapse` arguments together to specify different separators for different levels of the input:
```r
z <- list(c("red", "green"), "blue")
paste(z, sep = ":", collapse = ", ")
# "red:green, blue"
```

**Note:** The `collapse` argument in `paste()` is used to combine the elements of a vector into a single string, while the `sep` argument is used to specify the separator between the elements being concatenated together, i.e., `sep` separates the entries within the concatenated pairs.

Finally, you can use the `quote` argument to specify whether or not to surround the output with quotation marks:

```r
paste("Hello", "world!", quote = TRUE)  
# "\"Hello\" \"world!\""
paste("Hello", "world!", quote = FALSE) 
# "Hello world!"
```

## Practice

Fill in the gap to combine the elements of the vector `c("red", "green", "blue")` into a single string, separated by a comma and a space:

```r
z <- c("red", "green", "blue")
paste(z, ??? = ", ")  
# "red, green, blue"
```

- `collapse`
- `sep`
- `quote`
- `combine`

## Revision

Which of the following lines of code will combine the elements of the list `list(c("red", "green"), "blue")` into a single string, using colons as separators within the elements and commas as separators between the elements?

???

- `paste(list(c("red", "green"), "blue"), sep = ":", collapse = ", ")`
- `paste(list(c("red", "green"), "blue"), sep = ",", collapse = ": ")`
- `paste(list(c("red", "green"), "blue"), sep = ",", collapse = ":")`
- `paste(list(c("red", "green"), "blue"), sep = ":", collapse = " ")`
