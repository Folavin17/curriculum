# R Intro

## Content

**R** is a popular programming language and software environment for statistical computing[1] and graphics[2]. It is widely used among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers in academia and industry.

**R** is a high-level language, which means it has a relatively simple syntax. Here's an example of how you might plot a line graph in **R**:

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
plot(x, y)
```

**R** also has a vast community of users and developers, which has led to the creation of a large number of packages that extend its functionality. This means that **R** is capable of handling a wide range of tasks, from data manipulation and visualization to machine learning and data analysis.

## Practice

Let's try some **R** code! Do you know how to print a message to the console?

Don't worry; this is to get you comfortable with code.
You'll learn all about how this works in the upcoming lessons.

```r
message <- "Hello, world!"
???(message)
```

- print
- no i don't

## Footnotes


[1: Statistical Computing]
**R** is primarily used for statistical computing, which involves the use of statistical techniques to analyze data and make inferences about it. This includes tasks such as fitting statistical models to data, estimating parameters, and testing hypotheses.

[2: Graphics]
In addition to its capabilities for statistical computing, **R** is also known for its powerful graphics capabilities. It includes a variety of functions for creating plots and charts, which can be used to visualize and communicate data effectively.
