# Global Environment Variables

---

## Content

In **R**, a global environment is a place where all the objects you create are stored. When you start an **R** session, a global environment is created automatically.

You can use the `ls()` function to list the objects in the global environment:
```r
x <- 5
y <- 10

ls()
# "x" "y"
```

You can also use the `objects()` function to list the objects in the global environment:

```r
objects()
# [1] "x" "y"
```

To access the value of a global environment variable, you can type the name of the variable:

```r
print(x)
# 5

print(y)
# 10
```

You can also use the `get()` function to access the value of a global environment variable:
```r
get("x")
# 5

get("y")
# 10
```

To remove a global environment variable, you can use the `rm()` function:
```r
rm(x)

ls()
# "y"

objects()
# [1] "y"
```
