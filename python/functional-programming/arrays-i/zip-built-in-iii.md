# Unzipping

---

## Content

The star operator `*` can be used with `zip` to do the opposite action -- unzip a list.
This action takes an iterator of tuples and returns a tuple for each of the originally zipped lists[1]:

```python
a = ['a1', 'a2', 'a3']
b = ['b1', 'b2', 'b3']
c = ['c1', 'c2', 'c3']

result = zip(a, b, c)

x, y, z = zip(*result)

# Result:
# x = ('a1', 'a2', 'a3')
# y = ('b1', 'b2', 'b3')
# z = ('c1', 'c2', 'c3')
```

## Practice

We have three lists, `fnames`, `lnames`, `locations`, which are ordered so that each index represents the same person, i.e. `fnames[3]`, `lnames[3]` and `locations[3]` all refer to the same person. We want to create 2-tuples of the first and last name of each person and have these inside 2-tuples which match first+last name tuples with locations, such that the result looks like:

`[(('italo', 'calvino'), 'IT'),
  (('jean', 'micheal'), 'FR'),
  (('emily', 'rambert'), 'FR'),
  (('katya', 'sokolov'), 'RU')]`

Fill in the gaps in the code below to achieve this.

```python
locations = ['IT', 'FR', 'FR', 'RU']
fnames = ['italo', 'jean', 'emily', 'katya']
lnames = ['calvino', 'micheal', 'rambert', 'sokolov']

result = zip(???, ???)
result2 = zip(???, ???)
print(result2)
```

- `fnames`
- `lnames`
- `result`
- `locations`
- `result2`
- `names`

## Revision

What would be the output of applying the `zip` built-in function to these arguments?

```python
dates = ['9/16',
        '12/16',
        '2/17']
values = [200, 150, 122, 90, 220]

print(zip(dates, values))

???
```

- `[('9/16', 200), ('12/16', 150), ('2/17', 122)]`
- `{('9/16', 200), ('12/16', 150), ('2/17', 122)}`
- `[['9/16', 200], ['12/16', 150], ['2/17', 122]]`
- `[('9/16', 200), ('12/16', 150), ('2/17', 122), (0, 90), (0, 220)]`
- `[('9/16', 200), ('12/16', 150), ('2/17', 122), (90), (220)]`

## Footnotes

[1:Uneven length = loss of information]
*Any information discarded in the initial `zip` step because of input iterables being of uneven length is not recovered when we unzip the result again; the information has already been discarded at the `zip` step.*
